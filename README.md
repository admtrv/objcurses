**objcurses** is a minimalistic 3D object viewer that runs in your terminal using `ncurses`. It renders `.obj` models in real time using ASCII characters and a simple rendering pipeline. The project was built from scratch in modern C++20 using up-to-date best practices and a clean modular design, as a personal exploration of low-level graphics programming - without relying on external graphic engines or frameworks.

# Features

- Render `.obj` files directly in terminal
- Real-time camera and directional light control
- Basic color support from `.mtl` material files
- Start animation with consistent auto-rotation
- HUD overlay for additional stats
- Minimal dependencies: C/C++, `ncurses`, math

# Use Cases

* Preview 3D files instantly without launching heavy editors
* Generate custom ASCII art for neofetch or terminal splash
* Style CLI tools or games with ASCII-based intros and visuals
* Animate coding workspace with rotating retro-style ASCII models
* Create stylish character-based GIFs from terminal-rendered scenes

# Usage

```bash
objcurses [OPTIONS] <file.obj>
```

## Options

```
-c, --color          Enable colors from .mtl file
-l, --light          Disable light rotation
-a, --animate <deg>  Start with animated object [default: 30.0 deg/s]
-z, --zoom <x>       Provide initial zoom [default: 1.0 x]
    --flip           Flip faces winding order
    --invert-x       Flip geometry along X axis
    --invert-y       Flip geometry along Y axis
    --invert-z       Flip geometry along Z axis
-h, --help           Print help
-v, --version        Print version
```

Examples:

```bash
objcurses file.obj               # basic
objcurses -c file.obj            # enable colors
objcurses -c -a -z 1.5 file.obj  # start animation with zoom 1.5 x
objcurses -c -a 10 file.obj      # start animation with speed 10.0 deg/s
objcurses -c --invert-z file.obj # flip z axis if blender model 
```

## Controls

Supports arrow keys, WASD, and Vim-style navigation:

```
←, h, a            Rotate left
→, l, d            Rotate right
↑, k, w            Rotate up
↓, j, s            Rotate down
+, i               Zoom in
-, o               Zoom out
Tab                Toggle HUD
q                  Quit
```

# Installation

Latest release available [here](https://github.com/admtrv/objcurses/releases). Replace `<version>` with the actual release version, e.g. `1.2.3`.

## Manual (build from source)

To manually compile and install `objcurses`, follow these steps:

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have CMake and a C++ compiler installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libncurses6 libtinfo6 -y
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/admtrv/objcurses
cd objcurses
```

### Compile the Program

```bash
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
make
```

### Install for Global Use (optional)

```bash
sudo make install
```

---

## From `.tar.gz`

To install `objcurses` from the binary archive:

```bash
tar -xzvf objcurses-<version>-linux.tar.gz
cd objcurses-<version>-linux
sudo mv objcurses /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/objcurses
```

---

## From `.deb`

For Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.), use:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i objcurses-<version>-linux.deb
```

To uninstall:

```bash
sudo dpkg -r objcurses
```

---

## Verify Installation

```bash
which objcurses
objcurses --help
```

You should now be able to use `objcurses` from anywhere in your terminal.

## Inspirations

* [Codeology](http://codeology.kunstu.com/)
  The seed of an idea. Codeology visualizes GitHub repositories as abstract 3D shapes made from symbols. This inspired me to create an ASCII-based 3D renderer from scratch.

* [Donut math (a1k0n)](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)
  Cool article that breaks down the logic of the classic `donut.c` - a rotating ASCII torus in terminal using C. A great example of terminal 3D rendering and a key resource for understanding core rendering math.

* [3D ASCII Viewer (autopawn)](https://github.com/autopawn/3d-ascii-viewer)
  Viewer of 3D models in ASCII, written in C. I treated it as a logical predecessor to my project - it helped me explore how more complex rendering math could work.

## Resources

* [Data Types (OpenGL Documentation)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Data_Type_%28GLSL%29)
  Used to understand standard OpenGL types like `vec3`, etc.

* [Polygon triangulation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_triangulation)
  For correctly converting complex polygon shapes into triangles for rendering.

* [OBJ Parsing (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52824956/how-can-i-parse-a-simple-obj-file-into-triangles)
  Clarified parsing of `.obj` files and preparing vertex data.

## Sample Models

* [Fox Model (PixelMannen)](https://opengameart.org/content/fox-and-shiba) was used throughout development for testing `.obj` and `.mtl` parsing and rendering. The files `fox.obj` and `fox.mtl` are located in `/resources/objects/`, and the same model was featured in the recorded demo footage.

* [Low Poly Tree (kiprus)](https://free3d.com/3d-model/low_poly_tree-816203.html) played a key role in identifying a flaw in the triangulation algorithm, as it contains complex non-convex polygons that exposed edge cases in ear clipping algorithm.
